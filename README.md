# Carpark System

This project is a simple car park management system developed for TeenTech. It demonstrates basic functionality such as motion detection, license plate recording, space selection, and gate control.

## Features

* **Motion Detection:** Simulates motion detection to trigger the system.
* **License Plate Recording:** Records the license plate of the detected vehicle.
* **Authorized License Plate Check:** Verifies if the recorded license plate is authorized to enter the car park.
* **GUI for Space Selection:** Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to select an available parking space.
* **Dummy Gate Control:** Includes a placeholder function to simulate opening the car park gate.

## Technology

* **Python:** The project is written in Python.
* **GUI:** Uses a Python GUI library (likely Tkinter, based on common practice) for user interaction.

## Usage

The project simulates the basic process of a car park system.

1.  Motion is detected.
2.  The license plate is recorded.
3.  The system checks if the license plate is authorized.
